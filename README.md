# DREM-D_App

This project is going to provide a web application.

Dam removal is a highly challenging task and is related with environment, ecology, hydrology, vegetation, biodiversity 
and many other factors. Satellite imagery can be an effective measure if we want to understand the pre and post removal
condition of a particular dam removal location. 

We have planned to develop a web application that will provide important information about dam removal
to the companies who are working with this kind of project

We will mainly use planet imagery for our purpose.
